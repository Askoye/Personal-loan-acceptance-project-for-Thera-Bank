# Personal-loan-acceptance-project-for-Thera-Bank

## Description
Thera Bank's management wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers. The data used is based on a marketing campaign that the bank ran last year towards sales of the personal loan. The data scientists at Thera have been tasked to study the factors that will determine whether a customer will accept a personal loan.
The aim of the project is to predict whether an individual will accept a personal loan given various factors. 
These insights will assist in giving a detailed analysis of the performance and success factors of personal loans are borrowed money that can be used for large purchases, debt consolidation, emergency expenses and much more and are paid back in monthly installments over the course of typically two to six years.


## Experimental Design


The following are the steps that we will take to conduct this project. They are listed below:
* Business Understanding: Understanding the business problem.
* Reading the data to a pandas dataframe: Reading our dataset as well as the definitions dataset.
* Checking our data: Reading the head and tail of our dataset.
* Data cleaning: Converting column names to lowercase, dropping irrelevant columns, changing errors in entry.
* EDA: Visualizing our data using univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis.
* Implementing the solution: We will be using Decision trees, SVM, Naive Bayes, KNN , Random Forest and ADABoost models to make predictions.
* Conclusion: Giving the best model for our predictions.
* Challenging the solution: Using Neural Networks.
